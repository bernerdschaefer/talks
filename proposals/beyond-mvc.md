# Beyond MVC

Target Audience
---------------

Beginner and intermediate Rails developers

Abstract
--------

A Rails application is built from models, views, and controllers. And helpers.
And mailers. And jobs. And services... It turns out it takes a lot more than
MVC to build a robust app -- and that's just what Rails generates for you!
We'll dive into the world of patterns that aren't yet part of the Rails canon,
but probably should be, exploring when and how to use them to improve the code
quality of your application.

Notes for Organizers
--------------------

I stopped working with Rails for a few years, and when I came back to it the
dialogue had changed: no more "skinny controller, fat model", but service
objects in the standard template?! And form objects? Query objects? It took me
a while to grasp how and when to reach for these and other evolving Rails
patterns, but there's no question that the Rails code I write today is much
better for them. That's what I hope to share with others!
