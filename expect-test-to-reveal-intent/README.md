# expect(test).to reveal_intent

This talk was first given at TestRubyPDX.

You can read through the deck as a [normal document](slides.md),
or click through in [presentation mode][present].

  [present]: https://gnab.github.io/remark/remarkise?url=https://raw.githubusercontent.com/bernerdschaefer/talks/master/expect-test-to-reveal-intent/slides.md

After each section, there are some sample snippets of (mostly) real specs
that can be refactored using the techniques covered in the section.

I've included some sample refactorings I prepared ahead of time,
but you can also compare with [the solutions][solutions]
we came up with as a group.
